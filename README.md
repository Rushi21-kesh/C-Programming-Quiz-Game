# C-Programming-Quiz-Game
To create this game I used concepts of case statements, looping, functions and other basic concepts of programming.                               


## First, we run the code go to the output page of game it gives you choice such as:                                                                                                      
      - to start the game press "S" key                
      - read about the game press "A" key                  
      - need help then press "H" key                        
      - to quit the the game press "Q" key 
                   
       
       
When you start the game you need to enter your name and then show a questions if you answer correctly then it gives wining price and if you gives all answers correct then you shows a page which shows youâ€™re a millionaire also if you give wrong answer then it tell you your answer is wrong and your final wining amount.

## Wining amount according to questions:                                                      
      - Question 1 = 1000 /-                                                  
      - Question 2 = 5000 /-                                
      - Question 3 = 10000 /-                          
      - Question 4 = 20000 /-                           
      - Question 5 = 50000 /-                                  
      - Question 6 = 100000 /-                                 
      - Question 7 = 200000 /-                                       
      - Question 8 = 400000 /-                                 
      - Question 9 = 700000 /-                               
      - Question 10 = 1000000 /-
